## About the project

Welcome to The Drunk Chef application!

A website created to elevate your at-home cocktail experience. 

Using data from cocktail recipe and Youtube video APIs, you can select ingredients you have on hand and search for a tailored result of cocktail recipes. Once you find a cocktail that piques your interest, a simple click on the recipe opens a user-friendly modal where you'll find a list of ingredients, step-by-step recipe guide, and a video tutorial to ensure a seamless and enjoyable cocktail-making experience. 
 
 Enjoy!

How to use the website


### Build status
We prioritise seamless functionality and recognise that there is always room for improvement. This being the case we have reflected on some aspects of our website that we hope to improve in future iterations: 
- Implementing a solution for users to select from a wider range of ingredients
- We are exploring ways to implement a user profile system that allows individuals to create accounts, customize their preferences
- To further engage our users and foster a sense of community, we are planning to integrate social media sharing functionalities. This will enable users to share their favorite cocktail recipes, experiences, and even their own creations directly from the platform
- To enhance the user interaction within the community, we're considering adding a rating and review system.
