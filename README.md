## About the project

Welcome to The Drunk Chef application!

A website created to elevate your at-home cocktail experience. 

Using data from cocktail recipe and Youtube video APIs, you can select ingredients you have on hand and search for a tailored result of cocktail recipes. Once you find a cocktail that piques your interest, a simple click on the recipe opens a user-friendly modal where you'll find a list of ingredients, step-by-step recipe guide, and a video tutorial to ensure a seamless and enjoyable cocktail-making experience. 
 
 Enjoy!
